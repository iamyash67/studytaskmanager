## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML + Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5
- **Auth**: Django built-in authentication

## WCAG 2.2 Accessibility
- All forms have explicit `<label>` elements
- Error messages use `role="alert"` for screen readers
- Focus states styled with visible outlines (`:focus-visible`)
- Skip link added (`Skip to main content`)
- Live status updates use `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`
- `aria-label` on icon buttons for screen readers
- Colour contrast meets AA standard

## AJAX Interactivity
- Dashboard task completion uses asynchronous `fetch` requests to:
  - Mark a task complete without reloading
  - Update pending/completed counters
  - Move the task into the completed list instantly
- Progressive enhancement retained: links still fall back to the normal non-JS complete flow.

## Lighthouse Before/After Evidence (How To Capture)
1. Open Chrome DevTools on `/login/` and `/dashboard/`.
2. Run Lighthouse for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices.
3. Save screenshots/exports for the **before** report.
4. Apply UI optimizations (deferred JS, static CSS/JS, semantic landmarks).
5. Re-run Lighthouse on the same pages and save **after** screenshots.
6. Include tool, pages tested, key score changes, and short reflection in your report.

Suggested 4-6 line reflection:
- We deferred third-party and app JavaScript so rendering is less blocked on first load.
- We moved presentation and behavior out of templates into static CSS/JS files, reducing inline overhead.
- We reduced asset complexity to Bootstrap CDN plus one local stylesheet and one local script.
- We improved semantic structure (`main`, labels, status region, skip link), which improved accessibility scoring.
- Dashboard interactivity now uses AJAX updates instead of full reloads, improving perceived responsiveness.

## Run Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

Includes tests for:
- Dashboard auth protection
- User isolation on dashboard data
- AJAX completion behavior
- AJAX completion access control
